# Challenges
 
 1.The API was hard to learn and the router paths and which api was giving which response.
 2.The challenging thing was the infinite scroll it took more time for that.

 # Improvements

 1.Optimizing the code as the time was less. I did it less optimized way.
 2.if four more hours would be given i would add test cases
